    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>12 whole fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel; carefully break off stems. Chop stems extremely fine, discarding the tough end of stems.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and chopped mushroom stems; fry until any moisture has evaporated, taking care not to burn garlic. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Stir in cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne. The mixture will be very thick.</li>
            <li>Use a teaspoon to fill each mushroom cap with a generous amount of stuffing. Arrange mushroom caps on the prepared cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the mushrooms are piping hot, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
